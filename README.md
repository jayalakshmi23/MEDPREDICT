# MEDPREDICT

## üöÄ Overview
The **Hospital Readmission Prediction System** - MEDPREDCIT is a cutting-edge project designed to leverage advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict hospital readmissions within 30 days. Developed as part of the **DATA 298B Capstone Project** at **San Jose State University**, this system empowers healthcare professionals with actionable insights, enabling better patient care and efficient resource utilization.

---

## ü©∫ Objective
The primary goal is to reduce hospital readmissions by building a scalable, accurate, and real-time prediction system using the **MIMIC-III dataset**. The system integrates with healthcare IT systems to provide healthcare providers with insights to:
- Identify high-risk patients.
- Personalize care plans.
- Optimize hospital resources.

---

## üìä Dataset
The project utilizes the publicly available **MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care)** dataset, which includes:
- Patient demographics
- Admission and discharge information
- Medical history and diagnoses
- Clinical notes and lab results

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
### **Data Preprocessing**
1. Cleaned, tokenized, and normalized patient data.
2. Feature engineering to identify key predictors of readmission.

### **Model Training**
1. Trained multiple LLMs on structured and unstructured data.
2. Fine-tuned for maximum predictive accuracy.

### **Evaluation**
- Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### **Deployment**
- Real-time prediction system integrated with a React-based user interface.

---

## üéØ Outcomes
- **Proactive Healthcare**: Early identification of high-risk patients.
- **Optimized Resources**: Improved allocation of hospital resources.
- **Enhanced Patient Care**: Reduced readmission rates and better health outcomes.
